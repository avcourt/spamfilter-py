These results are from timtest.py.  I've got three sets of spam and ham
with about 500 messages in each set.  Here's what happens when I enable
my latest "received" header code:

    false positive percentages
        0.187  0.187  tied
        0.749  0.562  won    -24.97%
        0.780  0.585  won    -25.00%

    won   2 times
    tied  1 times
    lost  0 times

    total unique fp went from 19 to 17

    false negative percentages
        2.072  1.318  won    -36.39%
        2.448  1.318  won    -46.16%
        0.574  0.765  lost   +33.28%

    won   2 times
    tied  0 times
    lost  1 times

    total unique fn went from 43 to 28

Anthony's header counting code does not seem to help.
