No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:

	# mount -o remount,rw /usr

This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.

Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
apologies.)
