But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g.
Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are
fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you
still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be
alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best
which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
drives become cheaper.

Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term
significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static
application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large
client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because
these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different
sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also
tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular
with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence
services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a
physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application
server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I
use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable
because the "unchangeable" partitions might be written to for temporary swap
space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)

My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID
device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image
partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but
solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of
base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the
server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then
market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that
rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer
overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized
modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this
particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend
application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself
has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could
help.

I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a
hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no
knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a
product, I'd love to hear about it.
