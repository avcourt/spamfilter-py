Folks,

     There have been several major internet outages this morning,
     across major providers UUNet, Genuity, and god knows who else.
     Various routes across the Internet backbones have been
     disappearing, repropagating, and disappearing again.

     This has caused and exacerbated several problems which we are
     working on correcting right now.  We apologize for the
     inconvenience..

Best,=20
