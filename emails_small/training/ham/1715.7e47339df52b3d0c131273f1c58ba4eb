I've been testing Razor, invoked from sendmail/procmail and so far it
seems pretty copacetic. Last night's spam to the list provided a good test
- the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged, as
other list members reported.

This morning I piped the messages out from pine, being careful to use the
RAW mode, to razor-check -d. None of the messages come back as spam, even
the spam. Since folks revoked the false positives, I understand why they
would not come up, but not the spam itself, unless that also was revoked.

Is this spam just a bad one to test against, or is there some setting in
pine or razor that I am missing?
