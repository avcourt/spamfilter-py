How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?

As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.

Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.

Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,
deccy.
